# Week 7 Lab Report: CSE 15L

**In this lab report, I will go over how to quickly complete complete the tasks given to us during lab this past week.**

## Initial Set-Up
In order to set up, I first forked the Lab 7 [repository](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7). Additionally, I generated SSH keys for my ieng6
remote account and my Github account so I didn't have to type in my passwords.
